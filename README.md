## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   \`\`\`
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/blockchain-bridgeway.git
   \`\`\`

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   \`\`\`
   cd blockchain-bridgeway
   \`\`\`

3. Install dependencies:
   \`\`\`
   npm install
   \`\`\`
   or
   \`\`\`
   yarn install
   \`\`\`

4. Start the development server:
   \`\`\`
   npm run dev
   \`\`\`
   or
   \`\`\`
   yarn dev
   \`\`\`

5. Open your browser and visit \`http://localhost:3000\` to see the application running.

## Development Workflow

1. **Component Development**: Create or modify components in the \`src/components\` directory.
2. **Styling**: Use Tailwind CSS classes for styling. Custom styles can be added in the \`src/index.css\` file.
3. **Adding New Pages**: Create new page components in the \`src/pages\` directory (if using React Router).
4. **State Management**: Utilize React Hooks for local state management. For more complex state, consider using Context API or a state management library like Redux.

## Building for Production

To create a production build, run:

\`\`\`
npm run build
\`\`\`
or
\`\`\`
yarn build
\`\`\`

This will generate a \`dist\` folder with your compiled assets, ready for deployment.
